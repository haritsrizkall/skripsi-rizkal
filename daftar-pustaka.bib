abstract = {In this study, we present our novel development of a general gateway system for data collection in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The unique characteristic of our developed WSN gateway is that it has been designed easily configurable for nearly any WSN data collection applications, with diverse data managements and WSN protocols. In particular, it supports WSN transport layer at the gateway. Our implementation leverages Java and widely adopted TinyOS platform for various WSNs. We have conducted thorough tests for the validation of our developed gateway system, including the use of three realworld WSN field test-beds. The evaluation and validation results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our gateway system.},
